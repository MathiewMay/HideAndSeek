# HideAndSeek
HideAndSeek is a simple Minecraft gamemode with two teams, hiders and seekers, hiders need to hide from the seekers, when a hider is eliminated they join the seekers team.
Hiders use Minecraft blocks to hide, they can either hide as a block entity, or as a solid block, when they are in a solid block state they can't move or they will be put back in the block entity state.

Known Bug
- Sometimes when a hider does not select a block before the hCountdown is over it won't actually select one for them. (not sure if this bug is fixed or not)
- ~~With the support of multiple Maps, sometimes players get mixed between the waiting room of the new map and old map at the end of a game.~~

Todo
- (1) Make it so that seekers can attack solidified hiders.
- (2) Make dead hiders go in the seekers team.
- (3) Make it so that seekers can attack a hider's follower.
- (4) Invisible system using ProtocolLib
